# Pymaceuticals-Matplotlib-Analysis
 
 ## Introduction
 
 Here is an analysis of the most recent animal study of Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals, using Matplotlib and Pandas. In the animal study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.

 In this analysis, the animal study data were cleaned and sorted, and then the Matplotlib and Pandas methods were used to analyze and compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug regimen, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens. Various statistical charts were also drawn to provide the visualizations.

 ## Instruction

There are two files included in the anlysis:
- **pymaceuticals_analysis.ipynb** 
    - This is the file that contains the main script to run the analysis and the statistical charts.
- **data** folder
    - This folder contains the two CSV files (raw data from the animal study).

## Conclusions 

1. The animal test has selected the mice fairly in terms of gender selection. Based on the pie chart, we can tell that the number of female mice almost equals to the number of male mice. In terms of the mice weights, our analysis shows that there is a positive correlation between the mice weight and the tumor volume (aka, the heavier the mice, the larger the tumors grow).

2. Capomulin has proven itself to be the best regimen in this animal study. By looking at the final tumor volumes of the "Top 4" regimens, mice under the Capomulin treatment appeared to have the second smallest tumor volumes. In addition, in terms of the chance of surving, Capomulin has the most mice counts over the study time. Therefore, the result shows that Capomulin performs the best by both slowering the growth of tumors and increasing the chance of survival.

3. Capomulin's biggest competitor would be Ramicane. Ramicane, another drug regimen, has shown very similar top results to Capomulin's results. In order to make Capomulin more competible, Pymaceuticals should dedicate more resources into the development of Capomulin -- it is already worth the investment, but we can make it even better!
